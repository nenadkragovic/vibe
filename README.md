Web app for music

We made this site for faculty project. The point was to learn how to use NoSQL data bases.
We used MongoDB as main data base and Redis for caching large files.
App is built in ASP.NET, using Bootstrap, JQuery and KnockOutJS libraries for front-end.

On this site you can search for music, upload your own songs, make public or private playlists, follow other users and play their public playlists.
